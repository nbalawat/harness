# Underwriting Command Center — slices

## Slice 1 — Deal intake, triage agent, and pipeline board (`deal-intake-and-triage`)

An RM files an SMB loan request (`POST /api/deals`) and it becomes a tracked
deal in stage `intake`. The Intake Triage Agent (`POST
/api/deals/{deal_code}/agents/intake-triage/run`) classifies the request,
lists required document types still missing, and recommends an analyst
queue — deterministically, with the LLM narrative kept as advisory context so
the roster's confidence/queue guarantees always hold. Only after an analyst
explicitly accepts the proposal (`POST
/api/deals/{deal_code}/triage/accept`) is the deal assigned to a queue and
routed into `document_extraction`. Every deal is visible on the pipeline
board (`GET /api/pipeline`), grouped by its current stage. Backend:
`ext_deal_intake.py`, plus new shared helpers `deals_repo.py` (event-sourced
deal reads over db.store) and `identity.py` (acting_user_email → users row).
`ext_audit.py`'s `record()` now also persists a normalized row into the
`audit_log` table for every mutation, and `agent_runtime.respond()` takes an
optional `agent_name` so slices after this one can address the roster's other
agents by name. Frontend: the Pipeline Board screen (`screen-pipeline-board`)
gained a "File a New Deal" intake form and an "Intake Triage" proposal panel
(run + accept), and its eight columns now render live from `/api/pipeline`.

**Revision (attempt 2):** the design's Section Index nav was inert, so no
screen but the chat desk could ever be reached (and the slice demo could not
reach its own board). `app.js` now wires the header nav
(`[data-screen="…"]` → `#screen-…`, foundation behaviour every later slice
inherits) and emits a `screen:shown` event the board uses to re-read
`/api/pipeline` when it is brought to the front. The Pipeline Board's find-bar
is now live too: search, stage, owner, risk grade, exposure, and age narrow
the server-loaded deals and report how many of the book is showing. Backend
behaviour is unchanged.

**Revision (attempt 3) — foundation security hardening** from the governance
`code_audit` findings. No feature behaviour changed; every recorded acceptance
check still passes exactly as written and all five screens still work.

1. *The generic `/api/{table}` passthrough is no longer an open door.* Generic
   WRITE access is removed entirely — `POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /api/{table}` now
   returns 405, and `main.py` no longer reaches `store.insert` at all; every
   mutation goes through an explicit endpoint that checks role authority and
   records an audit row. Generic READ is restricted to
   `main.GENERIC_READ_TABLES` — `lending_policy`, `adverse_action_reasons` and
   `business_calendar`, the non-sensitive reference/lookup data the UI reads
   directly. Borrower records, spreads, ratios, grades, memos, exceptions,
   approvals, agent outputs, human reviews, Q&A sessions, the audit log and
   the `users` table return 403 there and are served only by their
   access-controlled feature endpoints.
2. *Central server-side role enforcement lives in the identity layer.*
   `identity.py` now carries `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` (relationship_manager submits
   and views its own; credit_analyst spreads/grades/drafts/recommends;
   senior_credit_officer adds approve/decline/return/reassign; admin
   unrestricted) plus the exported guards every ext module should use:
   `require_actor(email, permission, action)` — DEFAULT-DENY, so an email that
   resolves to no stored user can mutate nothing — and `has_permission`,
   `can_view_deal`, `visible_deals` for read scoping. `resolve_user` is now
   documented as provisioning only, never authorization. `ext_deal_intake.py`
   guards all three of its mutations through `require_actor`, including inside
   the two workflow handlers (which are independently reachable through
   `workflow_engine.start()`), and `GET /api/deals` scopes the book to the
   caller when one identifies itself.
3. *Route ordering is enforced, not assumed.* `ext_workflow_runs.py`'s
   `/workflows…` routes (and every other ext router) are mounted by the loop
   at the top of `main.py`, strictly before the `/api/{table}` catch-all is
   declared. `main._assert_route_ordering()` now runs at import time and
   raises on boot if any later slice registers an `/api/…` route after the
   catch-all, so a shadowed endpoint can never ship silently.
